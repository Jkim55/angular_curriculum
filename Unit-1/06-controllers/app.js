// What is $scope?
// $scope is a JavaScript object that glues together controllers and views.. It autopmatically exists and is automatically injected into our view Properties that are on the $scope object are available to both the view and the controller.

// All properties added to the $scope are automatically available in our view.
// Most applications have a main method that instantiates and wires together the different parts of the application.

// Angular apps don't have a main method. Instead modules declarativel specify how an application should be bootstrapped. There are several advantages to this approach:

// The declarative process is easier to understand.
// You can package code as reusable modules.
// The modules can be loaded in any order (or even in parallel) because modules delay execution.
// Unit tests only have to load relevant modules, which keeps them fast.
// End-to-end tests can use modules to override configuration.
// What are Angular modules? What's the syntax for defining a module?
// You can think of a module as a container for the different parts of your app â€“ controllers, services, filters, directives, etc.

// angular.module('myApp', [])

// Why do we pass in $scope as an argument to controller functions?
// that's how the module attaches the model with the controllers.

// In Express, what are Angular controllers most analogous to?
// routes perhaps?
