* [Data Binding](/Unit-1/02-data-binding.md)
* [Angular MVC](/Unit-1/03-angular-mvc.md)

### Class Listing

For the class listing (left-hand side), you should see a list of classes with the associated students enrolled in each class. When you click on a `+` or `-` next to each student, the grade will increase or decrease by 1.

### Create Class & Student

When you create a new class it should be added to the Class Listing. When you create a new Class, it should show up in the dropdown list in the Create Student form. When you create a new student, it should show up under the specific class with a default grade of 'C'.

### Stats Listing

The right-side of the page should show stats for the classes. It will update the total number of classes and students as they change via the forms. The dropdown will allow a user to select a class. When it's selected, the average grade for the class will be shown.
